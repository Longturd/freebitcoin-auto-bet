# Disclaimer

This script doesn't guarantee you that you go to win every bet. Use it at your own risk

# How it works?

blah blah blah

# Params (config var)

+ maxBet: when reach this value the scrip ends.
+ delay: this combined with other values is the delay between bets.
+ payout: payout multiplier.

# Issues

+ When the minBet is set in the textbox it's shows in E-notation (xe-x). Isn't critical.
